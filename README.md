# EnviroHealthPodcast

This project contains the webpage for the EnviroHealth Podcast. There are 3 pages:

* App.js - hosts the side bar with logo, description, links to other pages and social links
* People.js - Cards for pod members
* Podcasts.js - Spotify embeds for each podcast. This needs to be updated along with corresponding tags each time a new episode is released.
